- Data export functionality
- Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.7 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. (Optional) Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Running Both Servers

To run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously:

1. Start the backend server (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend server (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd project
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

For production deployment, create a `.env.production` file with your deployed backend URL:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-deployed-backend-url.com
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy Frontend to Netlify and Backend to a Python Hosting Service

1. **Deploy Frontend to Netlify:**
   - Build your frontend: `npm run build`
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify or connect your Git repository
   - Set the build command to: `npm run build`
   - Set the publish directory to: `dist`
   - Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
     - Key: `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
     - Value: `https://your-deployed-backend-url.com`

2. **Deploy Backend to a Python Hosting Service (e.g., Render):**
   - Create an account on Render (or another Python hosting service)
   - Connect your Git repository or upload your backend code
   - Set the build command to: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Set the start command to: `python app.py`
   - Add environment variables:
     - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
     - `DB_NAME`: Your database name
     - `COLLECTION_NAME`: Your collection name
   - Update your frontend's `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to point to this deployed backend

### Option 2: Deploy Both to Render (Recommended for Simplicity)

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Set the root directory to: `project` (for frontend) or `backend` (for backend)
4. For frontend:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start` (you may need to add this to package.json)
5. For backend:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start command: `python app.py`

### Option 3: Using the Custom Server (server.js)

If you prefer to use a custom Node.js server for serving your frontend:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

This approach is useful for:
- Local testing of the production build
- Deployment to platforms that support Node.js
- Having more control over how files are served

## Data Structure

The member data structure includes the following fields:
- `id`: String (generated by the frontend)
- `profilePicture`: String (optional)
- `name`: String
- `mId`: String (Member ID)
- `mobile`: String
- `trainingType`: String
- `address`: String
- `idProof`: String
- `batch`: String
- `planType`: String
- `purchaseDate`: String (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `expiryDate`: String (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `totalAmount`: Number
- `amountPaid`: Number
- `dueAmount`: Number
- `paymentDetails`: String

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful endpoints:
- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /api/members` - Get all members
- `GET /api/members/<member_id>` - Get a specific member
- `POST /api/members` - Create a new member
- `PUT /api/members/<member_id>` - Update a member
- `DELETE /api/members/<member_id>` - Delete a member
